# 🧭 OneTab Browser (Minimal Electron Browser)

A lightweight, custom-built browser I made using Electron — designed to help you **focus**, stay **distraction-free**, and not fall into the usual multi-tab rabbit hole.

## 🚀 What It Does

✅ **One-tab behavior**: Just a single tab — no clutter, no tab-hoarding  
✅ **Loads YouTube-only extension**: Activates ad blocker or minimal UI **only on YouTube**  
✅ **Default homepage**: Loads Google or whatever you want by default  
✅ **Custom icon + no menu bar**: Clean interface like a true minimal app  
✅ **Built into .exe**: Works offline, runs like any Windows application

## 🧩 Why I Built This

Like many devs and students, I kept opening YouTube for "just one tutorial"... and ended up 8 tabs deep into nonsense.

So I built a custom browser that:
- Keeps me to one tab
- Blocks distractions on YouTube only
- Feels lightweight like a native app

This is now my personal productivity browser — and I'm sharing it.
